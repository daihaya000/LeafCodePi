  // wrapper (`streamSimple`) that applies Claude Code OAuth request shaping
  // to every Anthropic request that reaches `provider-composer` (see the
  // coverage note below).
  //
  // Omitting `oauth` (and `models`) delegates login and refresh to Pi's
  // built-in `anthropicOAuth` and preserves Pi's built-in Anthropic model
  // list.  We previously supplied our own `oauth` override to harden refresh
  // rotation, but Pi 0.80.8 removed `loginAnthropic`/`refreshAnthropicToken`
  // from `@earendil-works/pi-ai/oauth`, so the override's deep import became
  // undefined and crashed `/login` (Issue #43); the built-in `anthropicOAuth`
  // now owns login/refresh instead.
  //
  // The transport wrapper replaces our previous `before_provider_request`
  // handler: that hook only fires for the interactive agent loop, so auxiliary
  // OAuth requests (built-in compaction, third-party background agents)
  // bypassed it and failed with Anthropic "extra usage" 400s.
  //
  // `registerProvider` stores this config in Pi's own `extensionProviders`
  // map, and `provider-composer`'s `streamWith` applies it to requests that
  // arrive through `modelRuntime`.  That covers the interactive loop,
  // compaction (which reuses `agent.streamFunction`), and extension model
  // calls through `ctx.modelRegistry.streamSimple()` (pi >=0.86.0), the
  // supported path for background agents.  It does NOT cover callers that
  // dispatch through pi-ai's own `compat.streamSimple` — extensions passing
  // it explicitly, and untyped callers that omit `streamFn` and land on the
  // `setDefaultStreamFn` fallback.  Up to pi 0.80.7,
  // `ModelRegistry.applyProviderConfig` bridged us into pi-ai's api registry
  // and those calls were covered too; the 0.80.8 `ModelRuntime` rewrite
  // dropped the bridge (Issue #46).  We deliberately do not re-add it: the
  // registry is keyed by api, not provider, so an override would divert all
  // ten `anthropic-messages` providers off their built-in branch, and staying
  // exact for `cloudflare-ai-gateway` would mean re-implementing compat's own
  // dispatch (Issue #53).  See `docs/architecture.md` for the full record and
  // the supported path for extension authors.
  //
  // The delegate is the built-in Anthropic transport resolved at runtime (see
  // `resolveBuiltinAnthropicStreamSimple`) rather than read out of the api
  // registry: `anthropicMessagesApi()` is the direct, non-deprecated handle
  // pi's own `custom-provider-gitlab-duo` example uses, and reading from a
  // registry we do not participate in would bind the delegate to whatever
  // another extension registered there last.  On pi <=0.80.7 it would also
  // have recursed, since the bridge put this wrapper in that slot.  The
  // related 0.79.x lazy-registration clobber is precluded by the >=0.80.8
  // peer floor (Issue #28, Issue #40).
  //
  // The factory is `async` because resolving the host transport performs a
  // dynamic import; Pi's `ExtensionFactory` permits a `Promise<void>` return,
  // and registration is deferred until the delegate is in hand so no Anthropic
  // call can resolve before our wrapper is registered.

  // Defensively clear any prior `anthropic` registration before installing our
  // wrapper.  Pi's `registerProvider` MERGES each registration's defined values
  // over the previous one and preserves `undefined` keys (an intentional
  // upstream contract), so it cannot clear a field by omission.  A stale
  // co-loaded copy of this extension that registered an `oauth` override would
  // otherwise survive our omission of `oauth` and keep clobbering login/refresh
  // (Issue #43).  `unregisterProvider` restores the built-in `anthropic`
  // provider first, so our re-registration starts from a clean slate.
  //
  // Caveat: during the initial load phase the loader's `unregisterProvider`
  // only drops registrations that are already *pending*, so this hardens the
  // case where the stale copy loaded *before* us; it is not a full guarantee if
  // the stale copy loads afterward.  Running a single up-to-date copy remains

  // falls through to the bare built-in transport: Claude Code headers but no
  // billing header, which Anthropic answers with a misleading "out of extra
  // usage" 400 (Issue #70).  The user names those providers in the config
