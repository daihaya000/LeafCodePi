// Section-aware sanitizer constants
//
// Pi 0.86.0 renders its system prompt as an untagged preamble followed by
// `<name>...</name>` sections, so the sanitizer decides section by section
// rather than paragraph by paragraph.  Content-bearing sections are matched
// on an anchor rather than on their name alone: upstream applies extension-
// registered sections after its own, so a section called `docs` need not be
// Pi's.
//
// Anchors stay resilient to upstream rewording — as long as the anchor still
// appears in the section, the rule fires regardless of surrounding changes.
// `test/upstream-prompt-drift.test.ts` checks each one against the installed
// Pi's own `buildSystemPrompt` output.
