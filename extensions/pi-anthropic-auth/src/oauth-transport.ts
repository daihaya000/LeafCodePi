/**
 * Wraps Pi's built-in Anthropic `streamSimple` transport so OAuth request
 * shaping runs on **every** Anthropic call path, not only the main agent loop.
 *
 * Pi only threads its `before_provider_request` hook into the interactive agent
 * loop.  Built-in compaction/summarization reuses `agent.streamFunction`, so it
 * reaches this wrapper through `modelRuntime` but carries no hook-supplied
 * `onPayload`.  Without our shaping those OAuth requests reach Anthropic with
 * no Claude Code billing header and are classified as third-party app usage,
 * producing the misleading "extra usage" HTTP 400.
 *
 * By injecting our shaping as an `onPayload` on the underlying transport, every
 * Anthropic OAuth request that reaches `provider-composer` is shaped regardless
 * of which Pi code path issued it.
 * The wrapper composes (does not replace) any caller-provided `onPayload`, so
 * other extensions' `before_provider_request` handlers continue to run on the
 * main loop, and our shaping is applied last — closest to the wire.
 *
 * Extension model calls through `ctx.modelRegistry.streamSimple()` (pi
 * >=0.86.0) also route through `modelRuntime`, so background agents that pass
 * it as their stream function are shaped.  Requests that dispatch through
 * pi-ai's own `compat.streamSimple` — passed explicitly, or reached through
 * the `setDefaultStreamFn` fallback when a caller omits `streamFn` — never
 * reach this wrapper on pi >=0.80.8 and remain unshaped (Issue #46,
 * Issue #53).  `docs/architecture.md` records why that gap is not closed here
 * and the supported path for extension authors.
 *
 * Gating is strictly OAuth-only: when the request is not an Anthropic OAuth
 * token, the payload passes through untouched, preserving Pi's normal
 * API-key and non-Anthropic transport behavior.
 *
 * @param delegate Pi's built-in Anthropic `streamSimple` transport, resolved
 *   at runtime by `resolveBuiltinAnthropicStreamSimple` (see
 *   `src/host-transport.ts`).  It is resolved directly rather than read out of
 *   the api registry: `anthropicMessagesApi()` is the non-deprecated handle
 *   pi's own `custom-provider-gitlab-duo` example uses, and reading from a
 *   registry this extension does not participate in would bind the delegate to
 *   whatever another extension registered there last.  On pi <=0.80.7 it would
 *   also have recursed, because `registerProvider` bridged this wrapper into
 *   that slot.  The related 0.79.x lazy-registration clobber is precluded by
 *   the >=0.80.8 peer floor (Issue #28, Issue #40).
 * @param learnedFloor The Claude Code version floor learned from Anthropic's
 *   `claude_code_version_too_old` rejections.  It is owned here, once per
 *   registered wrapper, because it must outlive the per-request billing
 *   version sync; the parameter exists so tests can observe it.
