/**
 * Per-request reconciliation of our `cc_version` with Pi's reported one.
 *
 * Two independent Claude Code version signals reach Anthropic on an OAuth
 * request: Pi's `user-agent: claude-cli/<version>`, and the `cc_version` in
 * the billing header this extension injects.  Anthropic gates new models on
 * the billing header when it is present, so a stale pin blocks a model even
 * when the host Pi is new enough.
 *
 * The bundled pin is a *floor*: when Pi reports a higher version, the
 * billing header is rebuilt at Pi's version on the way out.  When Pi is at or
 * below the pin — pi-ai 0.86.0 and pi 0.87.0 both report 2.1.251 — the
 * request is sent exactly as shaping produced it.
 *
 * When Anthropic raises a model's floor above both Pi and the pin, it rejects
 * the request as `claude_code_version_too_old` and names the floor (Issue
 * #75).  The sync then retries once with the billing header at that floor,
 * and teaches it to the shared {@link LearnedClaudeCodeFloor} so later
 * requests go out at it directly.  Only a 400 is ever read, and only through
 * a clone, so the streaming success path is untouched.
